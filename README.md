# Task_2 : TodoList Web App:
Github repo: https://github.com/mystique-sravya/OCTANET_JULY/tree/main/task_2_todosList

The to-do list website I created is a simple web application that allows users to manage their tasks and stay organized. Here's a brief overview of its features:

1. **Task Creation**: Users can enter a task in the input field provided and specify a due date using the date input field. Clicking the "Add" button adds the task to the to-do list.

2. **Task List**: The website displays the list of tasks below the input section. Each task is represented as a card, showing the task name, due date, and a checkbox to mark the task as completed.

3. **Persistence**: The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the data is persistent even when the page is reloaded or closed. This means users can revisit the website and see their previously added tasks.

4. **Task Completion**: Users can mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox next to the task. When a task is marked as completed, the card turns green.

5. **Task Deletion**: Each task card has a delete button with an "X" icon. Clicking the delete button removes the corresponding task from the list.

6. **Due Date Indicator**: If a task is not checked and the due date has passed, the task card changes its color to red, indicating that it's overdue.

7. **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The to-do list website provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks, allowing users to add, complete, and delete tasks easily. With the use of persistent storage, users can rely on the website to keep track of their to-do list over multiple sessions.
